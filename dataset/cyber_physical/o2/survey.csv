"As mentioned before, in this context, challenges related to the development, testing, and deployment of software and hardware components include version control, compatibility issues, security risks, and compliance with regulations and standards. To address these challenges, it is important to maintain accurate and up-to-date SBOM/HBOM that contains all the necessary data fields mentioned above. This can help in ensuring that the components are developed, tested, and deployed successfully, and any issues can be identified and addressed promptly.

Hence, while traceability in CPS is important, SBOMs/HBOMs are essential to it.",['Important'],"['CompatibilityIssues', 'Compliance', 'Important', 'SecurityRisks', 'VersionControl']"
