"""Art"" to me implies the evocation of deep thoughts and emotions, something that can force you to consider situations you hadn't before and truly empathize with people or characters. Rayne is as human a character as you might find in highly-regarded works of theater, literature, or film; he is torn apart by his conflicting desires, scared and flawed and yet compassionate and understandable. He is an incredibly interesting character and one who elicits sympathy despite his flaws.

Some are just meant to be fun like how some movies exist solely to be fun summer action flicks or accessible comedies.

"I hate to admit this, but it's got a lot to do with how 'seriously' the game takes itself. It distances itself from and subtly critiques gamer culture. IMO the feedback loop between game industry market logic and toxic gamer culture is the main thing stopping the medium from being broadly accepted as an art form. It's not the form or content of games themselves; it's the way they're consumed globally. The Beginner's Guide is as didactic as it is entertaining, and while I *do not* think that entertainment and art are mutually exclusive, I do think that aesthetically 'challenging' or hard-to-digest games are more easily framed as art in public discourse. Like... Being motivated primarily by profit haemorrhages credibility away from any art form, not just games.

Separately, the game made it feel like I was actually in dialogue with the developer. And it isn't shy about the unidirectionality of that relationshipÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂhe does what he wants in order to progress his narrative, like pulling you out of a level or turning on 'noclip', etc.

Ultimately, I guess I *like* to think of The Beginner's Guide as art because it would be damned near impossible for anyone to argue that it's *not* art.

"This game is mainly a walking simulator, so there is limited gameplay, but the gameplay that is present is directly related to the current narrative. The gameplay drives the story along and doesn't/can't exist on its own. The game felt like an animated short movie that you would normally just watch, but you get to walk through it at your own pace and drive the narrative yourself.","[emotional connection; emotional response, immersion, storytelling, interactive narrative, sense of agency]",gameplay related to narrative; player driving the narrative,emotional connection; emotional response; immersion; storytelling; interactive narrative; sense of agency,1.0003688322288243e-231,{0.5302053093910217},{0.10526315789473685}

"To reiterate, I think gameplay needs to be the primary consideration when looking at games as art. The genocide route deliberately plays with the typical tropes of RPG gameplay. Namely, grinding and the implications of it: the slaughter of hundreds of creatures just to see a number go up and your strength increasing; the lives left behind; the motivations of your character; etc.. It also makes it as tedious as possible, both to prevent people from accidentally doing it and to reinforce the decision you've made.",[emotional response; gameplay],gameplay; playing with the tropes; implications of player choices,emotional response; gameplay,0.0,{0.5768883228302002},{0.16666666666666666}
