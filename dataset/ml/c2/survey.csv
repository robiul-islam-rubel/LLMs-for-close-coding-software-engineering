"There needs to be some trade off between working out of the box and being customizable. For example at work we are currently using ClearML for training and monitoring, however ClearML's documentation is mostly you don't need to do anything, we do everything for you, they are applying a lot of features we don't need/want while failing to do other things - like tracking metrics on a custom training loop - automatically. Then their documentation is not very good, as they expect their users to do the exact usecase they described, using certain training libraries. Making it more complicated to manually add metrics you want to add (although the solution was easy after knowing what the solution was)
A good tool would make clear if it goes all in on acertain tool chain or - as I would prefer - make it easy to adapt it to any training I want, giving me options to adapt on several ways so I can choose the adoption that is the easiest for me.","['CustomizableTools', 'UseCases']","['UseCases', 'CustomizableTools']"
