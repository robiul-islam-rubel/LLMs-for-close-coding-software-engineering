"Some of the fields that would ideally be present are difficult to complete, requiring domain specific knowledge. If I'm good with image models and happen to also want to propose a new dataset, it is difficult for me alone to do all the analysis to create a full DataBOM. I will need people experienced in different domains, such as ethics, data science, and data visualization.",['FillingFields'],['FillingFields']

"Finding a good mix between accurate versioning and many updates. I would want to be able to access any version I trained a model with (or used some kind of data analysis on) but I would not like to have an updated version whenever I updated a single label (because then there would be thousands of versions if I update thousands of labels in a short time period).

I also would like to be able to automatically check labeled data so I can inspect possible structural labeling errors as soon as possible (e.g. detect that something is marked as a date that is not parseable as a date, or having an invoice where the uid is not labeled).
In general I would expect any DataBOM being well integrated with a labeling tool - at best with several of the opensource labeling tools available - while not forcing to use exactly that tool.","['Versioning', 'VerifyData']","['VerifyData', 'Versioning', 'Updating']"
