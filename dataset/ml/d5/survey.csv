"If you are proposing a dataset, make a dataBOM along with it. if you are using data, link to the dataset using a resource that also has the dataBOM accessible. If you are doing any sort of training in the process of working with data, create an AIBOM describing this training. I think that they should be separate overall, with each serving to describe a different category of things.",['Separate'],['Separate']
The data is what defines what the model will learn. So knowing about the data half the story of a model.,['Base'],['BadAnswer']

The link between AIBOMs and DataBOMs (Data Bill of Materials) is critical for guaranteeing openness and accountability in ML/DL system development and deployment.,['Complementary'],['BadAnswer']
Aibom should have a reference to at least a validation dataset and probably performance metrics with it,['References'],"['References', 'Separate']"
I see them as independent.  An AIBOM should refer to a DataBOM where applicable.,['Separate'],"['Complementary', 'NonSymmetric', 'References', 'Separate']"

AIBOM should point to one or more DataBOM that describe the training data used to create the model.,"['References', 'NonSymmetric', 'OneToMany']","['OneToMany', 'References', 'Separate', 'NonSymmetric', 'Complementary']"
"DataBOMs should be the base of AIBOMs, as how different datasets are processed, curated, and labeled largely affect the performance and usability of the ML/DL system. Misuse of data could lead to harmful consequences, including hate responses, privacy leaks, and infringement of IP and copyrights.","['Base', 'DataBomPartOfAibom']",['Base']

DataBOMs are a subset of AIBOMs. Any ML/AI model shipped with an AIBMO was trained on data that is described with a DataBOM.,"['NonSymmetric', 'OneToMany', 'Base', 'DataBomPartOfAibom']",['Complementary']
