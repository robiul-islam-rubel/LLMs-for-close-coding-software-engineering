Separate,"AIBOMs and DataBOMs can be used together, but should be two separate entities"
BadAnswer,"The response doesn't answer the asked question. The response is incoherent, rambling, etc.

The answer speaks specifically about the relation between data and AI instead of their associated BOMs"
Complementary,AIBOMs and DataBOMs should be used together
ChatBot,The answer likely was derived from a chatbot and should thus be excluded from analysis
References,Clear and unambiguous references should be used to link AIBOM to DataBOM and vice versa
Integratable,Integration should be easy (i.e. databom integration with aibom should be easy)
NonSymmetric,"The relationship between AIBOM and DataBOM isn't symmetric.  That is that AIBOMs can include references to DataBOM, but DataBOMs shouldn't include references to AIBOMs."
OneToMany,The AIBOM to DataBOM relationship can be described as a one-to-many.  A single AIBOM can reference one or more DataBoms.
Base,DataBOMs serve as the base / foundation for AIBOM
AiForDownstream,AIBOMs are generated for downstream components
DataFromUpstream,DataBOMs are acquired from upstream components
PackagedTogether,"DataBOMs and AIBOMs should somehow be packaged together, since one without the other is useless."
DataBomPartOfAibom,The information from a databom should be included in an aibom
Unsure,"Answer equivalent to I don't know"
Compatible,AIBOMs need to be made compatible with databom and vice versa
