code,definition
Adoption,The completeness and correctness of DataBOMs will improve as the technology is adopted.
AcademicRequirements,"Make the usage of complete and correct DataBOMs required in academic settings, e.g. required for submission to conferences and journals."
LegalRequirements,Impose a legal liability for creating DataBOMs which are incorrect or misrepresentative.
TrustedThirdParty,"A trusted community, board, or organization should verify the completeness and correctness of DataBOMs."
ValidationTools,Tools and tests should be able to verify the completeness and correctness of DataBOMs.
AutomaticValidation,"Validation should occur automatically at some point in the process of creating and storing DataBOMs, such as on submission to a version control system."
CryptographicVerification,Protect the authenticity of the DataBOM with a cryptographic hash or similar tools.
DataGovernance,Employ data governance techniques to ensure the completeness and correctness of DataBOMs.
Documentation,Thorough documentation aids in achieving completeness and correctness.
FormalMethods,Formalization can help to verify the completeness and correctness of DataBOMs.
Testing,Rigorous testing can help ensure the completeness and correctness of DataBOMs.
StandardizedProcedures,Standardized training procedures can monitor data used and prevent inaccuracies from appearing in DataBOMs.
Unsure,"Answer equivalent to "I don't know"
ProvenanceInformation,Including provenance information will help to determine the correctness of a DataBOM.
NotPossibleForPrivateInfo,Completeness and correctness cannot be assured when the DataBOM handles private information.
TraditionalMethods,Methods employed for data quality and insurance without DataBOM
Impossible,Impossible due to the nature of data collection or labelling.  Could be that data contains private or sensitive information or that the labeling cannot be characterized
MLBasedDataLabeling,Data described by DataBOMs could be labeled with machine learning techniques.
AuditTooling,Tools that can audit databom
UpgradeTooling,Tools that can upgrade databom or components
ZeroKnowledgeProof,Apply zero knowledge proofs to the problem
CostlessVerification,Build data integrity with costless verification (related to the block chain)
