code,definition
IncreasedAdoption,Increased use and adoption of AIBOM will help make accuracy checking easier
Documentation,More and improved documentation of AI models and / or there dependencies
Requirements,Requirements imposed by top paper venues or other sources.  These requirements will make AIBOMs more prevalent and more correct
ReproduceModel,The ability to successfully reproduce the model demonstrates the correctness of the AIBOM
BadAnswer,"The response doesn't answer the asked question.  The response is incoherent, rambling, etc."
Certification,Review boards or another 3rd party assess the correctness of an AIBOM or certify a particular vendor
ChatBot,The answer likely was derived from a chatbot and should thus be excluded from analysis
Databases,Compare AIBOM contents with available 3rd party databases.
PinnedVersions,The specific versions of dependencies used should be included explicitly
IncludedEnvironment,A docker container should be provided that has the training environment included
ContinuousIntegrationTests,Tests should be run as part of the continuous integration process
EstablishBestPractices,Establish a set of agreed upon rules and best practices for the creation of AI models and their accompanying AIBOMs
EmphasisOnDataDependencies,An emphasis should be placed on data dependencies
CommunityReporting,Users and developers can report false or incorrect dependencies in an AIBOM
ProvenanceInformation,Including provenance information will help to determine the correctness of an AIBOM
AutomatedTool,"Response proposes the use of a tool, even if the specific details aren't clear"
UniversalAPI,The establishment of a universal and agreed upon API
ListLibraries,List libraries used by a project to compare against the SBOM
ModelTrainedViaAIBOM,"The model and the AIBOM are inseparable and if the AIBOM is incorrect, then the model will not run"
ModelCode,AIBOM correctness can be verified by viewing the model's code.
ScreeningPipeline,Screening processes should be added to the development pipeline.  These could be automated tools and tests or actual manual reviews
ZeroKnowledgeProof,Apply zero knowledge proofs to the problem
CostlessVerification,Build data integrity with costless verification (related to the block chain)
