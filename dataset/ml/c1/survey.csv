"Idealy I don't have to implement features like versioing manually myself, and even get inspired to use techniques that I usually don't think of myself (e.g. I would have never written code to monitor the GPU memory usage or GPU compute utility while training, even if I didn't have a tool that would monitor it for me.) and therefore ensure that I am using best practices or to be more concrete, my colleagues with lesser experience use best practices without me having to tell them everything :-)
