Dependency information is required for technical reasons independent of any policy mandate.  That is how a software ecosystem operates.  Each project needs to provide the user a way to automatically include all needed dependencies with your project.  And there are common repos that host the universe of packages your project draws dependencies from.,[],['PackageManager']

"Nearly all direct dependencies are listed in package.json. This is generally the case for all JavaScript and TypeScript projects. Indirect dependencies are harder to see, although there are NPM/Yarn commands to list them. 

However, it's important to note that most such projects don't intentionally publish this list for external viewing. It's a side effect of using package.json. Also, any dependencies which have been customized are generally not listed here, and it's harder to view them - the convention is to place them in a vendor/ or libs/ folder but it's not always followed.",['PackageManager'],"['PackageFile', 'PackageManager']"

"For project begun recently (>2010), their dependencies were documented and tracked from the beginning. For older projects, the list was obtained by manually auditing build system files. The latter type of lists are suspected to be incomplete/inaccurate.

For projects I'm not actively involved in maintaining, I've used tool like `ldd` for this in the past.",['ManuallyTracked'],"['ToolAssisted', 'ManuallyTracked']"
