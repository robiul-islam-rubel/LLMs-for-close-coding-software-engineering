# 🔍 LLM for Close Coding
LLM for Close Coding is a research tool designed to automate the qualitative analysis process by assigning predefined codes to open-ended survey responses using Large Language Models (LLMs). It reduces the time and effort required for manual coding while improving consistency and scalability.

# 📌 Project Description
In qualitative research, close coding involves tagging textual responses with predefined categories based on a codebook. This project uses state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., LlaMa) to replicate this process automatically. Our system also supports multi-agent validation, model agreement analysis, and error checking. We also create a webpage where user can upload the survey response, the code and definition as a csv file.

# How to replicate
